# ToneBook

ToneBook is app to help musicians organize practice routines, and track their progress with exercises. This is mainly accomplished through an activity calendar which updates automatically through normal use of the app, and a metronome which registers and saves the BPM for each new exercise the user creates. The app is sandbox-style, allowing the user to put in as much or as little time into setting up each exercise - exercises are mapped to an optional YouTube video, a metronome which stores the BPM for that particular exercise, and an optional notes section. An exercise can be created with all three, or any individual one, and these exercises are housed inside of "routines" which are just folders for organization purposes.
